description: Check and update cross-session task tracking in TODO.md
---

Read `~/.claude/TODO.md` and:

1. **Review current state** — summarize what's pending, in alpha, and in beta
2. **Check for completions** — identify any items that are now done based on the current repo state
3. **Suggest updates** — propose moving items between statuses or adding new items based on recent work
4. **Apply changes** — update TODO.md with user-approved changes

Keep TODO.md concise and actionable. Remove items that are fully resolved.
