# Principles

- **Check docs proactively** — When uncertain about tools, APIs, or configurations, always consult documentation before guessing. You have full autonomy to do this without asking.

- **Don't assume, verify** — Do spot checks. Consult CLI `--help`, man pages, and official docs before making edits or suggestions. When in doubt, test it.
