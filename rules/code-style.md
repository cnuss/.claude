# Code Style

## Minimal Footprint

- Solutions shall be focused
- No over-engineering
- No unrequested features
- No speculative abstractions

## Context Before Action

- Read and understand code before modifying
- Never propose changes to code not yet read
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
